# UimPluginSdkReactDemo

## How to run the demo app

This app has been bootstrapped using create-react-app. You just have to run `npm install` 
followed by `npm start`.
Afterwards your browser should open http://localhost:3000/ in a new tab automatically.

As you can see in the screenshots below UIM Login plugin integration with React generally 
works: 

- Adding the uim-navigation element
- Adding the usercenter element
- Load the plugin scripts
- Language initialization
- Using the UIM API
- Register callbacks in order to react to events on the UIM bus
